    <h2 >Introduction</h2>
    <div class="commonclassdiv">
      <p>Mangalagiri Sarees and Fabrics are produced by performing Handicraft weaving in Manga lagiri, a town in Guntur District of Andhra Pradesh. It is one of many traditional Indian Han dlooms.The Mangalagiri fabric is produced by weaving with the help of pitlooms from
        combed yarn by warp and woof interlacing. The fabric then undergoes the process of dying. Some of the most commonly found patterns and motifs include the nizam pattern and
        floral motifs, the modern day weavers also entertain special orders with custom designs.</p>

      <h2>Aesthetic of Mangalagiri saree</h2>
      <p>Every handloom makes for an heirloom piece that speaks volume about our country’s
        culture and traditions. The uniqueness of a Mangalgiri weave is its minimalistic motifs,
        tribal embellishments, temple designs, a plain body with an intricate border and de tailed zari work. Another discrete feature is that the fabric is woven only pit looms, as it
        helps in exerting maximum force and results in a tightly knit weave.
        Mangalagiri saree are a piece of glory , woven from cotton having the most characteris tic features. As the town is also the house of Lord Narasimha swamy, the saris are also
        used by the devotees for devotional purposes</p>

      <h2>Specialty of Mangalagiri Sarees</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Counts or thread density per square inch range from 40 (coarse) to 120 (superfine), some times more. The fine count weaves in fact have a diaphanous or gossamer appearance and
        considered as export quality.</li>
        <li> The use of zari was once limited to borders. Today silver and golden coloured zari is a major
          attraction covering borders, the pallu (end piece) and popular motifs like leaf, mango, parrot,
        and gold coin. </li>
        <li> The experimentation with colours is phenomenal with basic designs given a new meaning
        with thrilling combinations of light pink with magenta border, maroon with mustard stripes, an
        olive green field with navy blue borders fuelling the imagination of the market.</li>
        <li> The Nizam border, unique to the Mangalagiri variety of handlooms, has tiny gopurams
        across the borders and showcases the religious fervor of the people in the backdrop of the
        three Narayan Swamy temples of the place</li>
      <li>The sensational range in shot cottons sport the double shades or shimmering effect sarees due to
        different coloured threads used in the warp and weft during the weave. Pleasing kaleidoscopic ef fects like greenish yellow, sunset orange, deep yellow result in the creations.
         Ikat woven motifs and tie & dye colouring techniques are skillfully employed for sensational offer ings in design and pattern in a panorama of fast organic and other colours.</li>
        <li>The use of bootis ( small woven motifs), stripes, checks pattern in different counts is done with fi nesse and accentuates the appeal of these handloom cottons very much. In fact in many cases the
        use of the jacquard loom has been done brilliantly.</li>
        <li>
        The speciality of these cotton saris are known for featuring micro checks or stripes on the field with
        a dense zari border giving the sari a beautiful drape. The pallu is mono-striped ornamented with
        solid lines of lustrous zari in typical tribal style</li>
        <li>The speciality of the extra warp design is a combination of twill, rib and diamond weaves and these
        weaves are arranged side by side continuously without any gap and that too design starts from the
        edge of the selvedge without leaving a single thread
