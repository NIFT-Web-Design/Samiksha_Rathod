                  <p>The Mangalagiri sarees have a history of more than five centuries. long before the sarees got
popularised, Mangalagiri was famous for its pilgrimage .The temple of Lord Panakala Narasimha Swamy is located in the centre of the town and is believed to have been there since the Satya Yuga. It is said that under the present temple lies the former Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy
temple, the one in which the main idol was installed by Yudhistira.
In around 1593, during the rule of Qutub Shahi, heavy taxes were imposed on the handloom
sarees of this region. As a result of this, the weavers started to move out of this town and started settling in other handloom centres of the state. This affected the weaving activities of this
town. Later, the succeeding rulers of this region opted for more sympathetic practices and reduced the taxes.</p>

                    <p>The Lord Panakala Narasimha Swamy temple that we see today, was built by Raja Vasireddi
Venkatadri Naidu between the years 1807-1809. As per the tradition in ancient times, the pilgrims needed to buy a saree from the local weavers after offering respect to the lord. It was
a way of giving the weavers a livelihood and thus increasing the popularity of these sarees.
There are three Narasimha Swamy temples in Mangalagiri – the Panakala Narasimha Swamy
on the hill, the Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy at the foot of the temple and the Gandala Narasimha Swamy at the top of the hill.A few 100 years back it all started with ‘muthaka sarees’, 50
years later ‘silver jeri sarees’ and for the past 30 to 40 years ‘Mangalgiri Nizam border sarees’
have become a popular choice worldwide</p>
